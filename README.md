# **Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict heart disease based on patient data. The dataset consists of 918 records with 12 key features. Various models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), were trained and evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning, **Gradient Boosting** emerged as the best-performing model with **88.6% accuracy and a ROC-AUC of 93.9%**. This project highlights the potential of AI in assisting early heart disease diagnosis.

## **Abstract**  
Heart disease is one of the major global health concerns. This project investigates whether machine learning models can accurately predict heart disease using a dataset containing **918 records and 12 features**. Models including **Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and MLP** were trained and evaluated using **accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**. **Gradient Boosting** achieved the best performance, with an **88.6% accuracy and 93.9% ROC-AUC**. The study also discusses dataset imbalance, hyperparameter tuning, and real-world deployment challenges.

 **Project Workflow**  
**1️-  Data Preprocessing**  
✔ No missing values detected  
✔ Encoded categorical variables  
✔ Normalized numerical features where necessary  
✔ Split data into **80% training and 20% testing**  

 **2️ - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
✔ Older patients with lower max heart rates have a higher risk  
✔ ST Slope and Chest Pain Type were strong predictors  
✔ Some cholesterol values were extreme, but retained for analysis  
✔ **Feature Selection:** Used **Random Forest Feature Importance** to rank key features  

 **3️ - Model Training & Evaluation**  
Five models were tested:  
| Model               | Accuracy | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |  
|---------------------|----------|---------|---------|  
| Logistic Regression | 87.5%    | 89.2%   | 89.6%   |  
| SVM                | 71.7%    | 74.3%   | 79.9%   |  
| Random Forest      | 87.5%    | 88.9%   | 92.3%   |  
| **Gradient Boosting** | **88.6%** | **89.7%** | **93.9%** |  
| MLP                | 83.7%    | 84.5%   | 90.5%   |  

### **4️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning**  
✔ **Gradient Boosting Best Parameters:**  
   - Learning Rate: 0.1  
   - Max Depth: 3  
   - Number of Estimators: 200  
✔ Optimized using **GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV**  

### **5️⃣ Model Deployment & Applications**  
✔ **Clinical Decision Support:** Assists doctors in diagnosis  
✔ **Wearable Health Devices:** Smartwatches & ECG monitoring  
✔ **Public Health Analytics:** Identifies high-risk populations for early intervention

## **Challenges & Considerations**  
✔ **Dataset Imbalance:** More patients with heart disease than without; fixed using stratified sampling  
✔ **Computational Costs:** Gradient Boosting required high processing power  
✔ **Ethical Considerations:** AI in healthcare needs transparency & regulatory compliance
